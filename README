    Overview

	Based on `python-qwt` (a pure Python/PyQt reimplementation of the curve 
      plotting Qwt C++ library, included in guiqwt base source code)
	and on the scientific modules NumPy and SciPy, guiqwt is a Python 
	library providing efficient 2D data-plotting features (curve/image 
	visualization and related tools) for interactive computing and 
	signal/image processing application development.
	
	Extension to `python-qwt`:

	  * set of tools for curve and image plotting
	  * GUI-based application development helpers

    Building/Installation

        All platforms:
            The setup.py script supports the following extra options for 
            optimizing the image scaler engine with SSE2/SSE3 processors:
                --sse2
                --sse3

        On GNU/Linux and MacOS platforms:
            python setup.py build install

        On Windows platforms with Microsoft Visual C/C++:
            python setup.py build install
	    
        On Windows platforms with MinGW:
            python setup.py build -c mingw32 install
